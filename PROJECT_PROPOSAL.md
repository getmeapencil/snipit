### 1. Title of the Project

**Snipit: A Secure and Shareable Snippet Management System**

### 2. Introduction and Objectives

In the digital age, the ability to quickly capture, manage, and share information is paramount for productivity and collaboration. Developers, writers, students, and professionals constantly work with fragments of informationâ€”code snippets, notes, commands, links, and temporary text. Existing tools like traditional note-taking apps can be too cumbersome for managing these small, ephemeral pieces of content, while simple text editors lack features for sharing and organization. This creates a gap for a specialized tool designed for efficient snippet management.

The "Snipit" project addresses this need by providing a streamlined web application for managing and sharing text-based snippets. The primary motivation is to offer a platform that combines the simplicity of a text editor with the power of a content management system, focused exclusively on snippets. The system is designed to be fast, accessible, and secure, allowing users to save three different "flavors" of content: Plain text, Code (with syntax highlighting), and Rich Text (with formatting).

The core of the project revolves around flexible sharing and access control. Users can keep snippets private for personal use, share them publicly with a wide audience, or share them selectively using unlisted links, which can be optionally password-protected. This granular control ensures that users can confidently store both sensitive information and public-facing content within the same platform. Upon saving, each snippet is assigned a unique, short, and shareable URL, making it easy to distribute.

**Objectives:**

- **To develop a robust web application** for creating, editing, and deleting snippets of various flavors (Plain text, Code with language syntax, Rich text).
- **To implement a secure user authentication system** using Google OAuth 2.0 to manage user accounts and protect private snippets.
- **To design and implement a flexible exposure and sharing system**, including public, private, and unlisted (password-protected) options.
- **To automatically generate unique and persistent links** for each snippet using nanoid to facilitate easy sharing.
- **To provide a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface** using modern UI components for a seamless user experience across different devices.
- **To ensure the application is performant and scalable** using a client-server architecture to handle a growing number of users and snippets.

Real-world applications for Snipit are numerous. A developer can use it to store and share reusable code fragments with their team, including specific programming language syntax highlighting. A technical support agent can use it to quickly share command-line instructions with a customer. An educator can create and share notes or formatted content with students using rich text capabilities. In essence, Snipit can serve as a centralized hub for any user who needs to manage and share small blocks of information efficiently.

### 3. Project Category

**Category:** Web Application / NoSQL Database System

**Justification:**

This project falls primarily into the **Web Application** category, as its core is a user-facing application delivered over the internet via a web browser. It involves modern front-end development using React with Vite and back-end development using Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic, RESTful API, and database interaction.

It also has a strong **NoSQL Database** component. The system's functionality relies heavily on a MongoDB database to store and manage data for users and snippets with their associated properties (like exposure, passwords, flavors, and relationships). The flexible schema nature of MongoDB is well-suited for the varying structure of different snippet types and the evolving nature of the application. The use of Mongoose ODM provides structured data modeling and validation while maintaining NoSQL flexibility.

#### Database Schema and Design

The database is designed using MongoDB with Mongoose ODM, featuring two primary collections: `User` and `Snippet`.

- **`User` Collection**: Stores information about users authenticated via Google OAuth.

  - `_id` (ObjectId, Primary Key): MongoDB's auto-generated unique identifier.
  - `googleId` (String, Required, Unique): Google's unique identifier for the user.
  - `email` (String, Required, Unique, Lowercase, Trimmed): User's email address from Google.
  - `username` (String, Optional): User's display name from Google profile.
  - `profilePicture` (String, Optional): URL to user's Google profile picture.
  - `createdAt` (Date, Auto-generated): Account creation timestamp.
  - `updatedAt` (Date, Auto-generated): Last update timestamp.

- **`Snippet` Collection**: Stores the snippets created by users.
  - `_id` (ObjectId, Primary Key): MongoDB's auto-generated unique identifier.
  - `name` (String, Required, Trimmed): The title/name of the snippet.
  - `content` (String, Required): The main content of the snippet.
  - `flavor` (String, Required, Enum): Type of snippet ("Plain", "Code", "Rich Text").
  - `language` (String, Conditional): Programming language for Code flavor snippets.
  - `exposure` (String, Required, Enum, Default: "public"): Visibility setting ("public", "private", "unlisted").
  - `password` (String, Optional, Hashed): Bcrypt-hashed password for unlisted snippets.
  - `author` (ObjectId, Required, Reference): Reference to the User who created the snippet.
  - `uniqueId` (String, Required, Unique): Nanoid-generated unique identifier for URL sharing.
  - `createdAt` (Date, Auto-generated): Snippet creation timestamp.
  - `updatedAt` (Date, Auto-generated): Last update timestamp.

**Relationships:**

- A **one-to-many relationship** exists between `User` and `Snippet`. One user can create many snippets, but each snippet belongs to only one user (`author` field).
- The `author` field in the `Snippet` collection is indexed for fast lookups.
- Additional indexes exist on `exposure` and `createdAt` for efficient querying of public snippets.

#### Pseudocode for Core Functions

**Create Snippet Logic (`/api/snippets` - POST)**

```
FUNCTION handleCreateSnippet(request):
  // Verify JWT token
  token = extractJWTFromHeaders(request)
  user = verifyJWT(token)
  IF user is NULL:
    RETURN 401 Unauthorized

  data = parse_json_body(request)
  // Validation: check required fields
  IF data.name OR data.content OR data.flavor is missing:
    RETURN 400 Bad Request

  // Generate unique ID using nanoid
  uniqueId = nanoid(10)

  snippetData = {
    name: data.name,
    content: data.content,
    flavor: data.flavor,
    exposure: data.exposure || "public",
    author: user._id,
    uniqueId: uniqueId
  }

  // Add language for Code flavor
  IF data.flavor == "Code" AND data.language:
    snippetData.language = data.language

  // Hash password for unlisted snippets
  IF data.exposure == "unlisted" AND data.password:
    snippetData.password = bcrypt.hash(data.password, 10)

  newSnippet = Snippet.create(snippetData)
  RETURN 201 Created, { snippet: newSnippet }
```

**View Snippet Logic (`/snippets/:id/public-view` - POST)**

```
FUNCTION handleViewSnippet(uniqueId, request):
  snippet = Snippet.findOne({ uniqueId: uniqueId }).populate("author")
  IF snippet is NULL:
    RETURN 404 Not Found

  // Check access permissions
  isAuthor = (user AND user._id == snippet.author._id)

  IF snippet.exposure == "private" AND NOT isAuthor:
    RETURN 403 Forbidden

  IF snippet.exposure == "unlisted" AND snippet.password AND NOT isAuthor:
    userPassword = request.body.password
    IF NOT userPassword:
      RETURN 200 { requiresPassword: true }

    IF NOT bcrypt.compare(userPassword, snippet.password):
      RETURN 401 Unauthorized

  RETURN 200 { snippet: snippet, isAuthor: isAuthor }
```
